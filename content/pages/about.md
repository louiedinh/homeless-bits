Me
---
Hi, my name is Louie and I'm a Hacker News, Quora and Reading addict.
 My business card identifies me as a "Software Engineer" at the mobile gaming company A Thinking Ape.

The Site
--------
Welcome to my digital home. I apologize in advance because I'm a bit of a messy person.
Like most homepages, this site links to my bio, past projects and contact information.
In addition it will serve as view into my "digital library"; a collection of documents that are the cornerstones of my education.
