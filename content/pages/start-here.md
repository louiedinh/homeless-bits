Summary: An overview of the project


Hacker's PhD
---
Software is eating the world and universities cannot keep up.
Computer science programs teach fundamentals but fail to bridge
 the gap to actual software development. On the other hand, code bootcamps
teach software development but fail to open your mind to the deep
and beautiful world of computation.

This is my attempt at filling the gap between a traditional
CS education and the actual practice of programming.

Hacker is a title of respect in the coding community. It refers
to a person who is skilled in creating beautiful, useful or
clever solutions.

A PhD is a terminal educational achievement. It signifies the 
transition from dependent student to independent scholar. To
receive a PhD, a student submits a thesis that proves he has
advanced the frontier of human knowledge. Matt Might does an
excellent job of illustrating a PhD [here][1].



Personal MBA
--------

Distribution is the other side of the meaningful work coin.

Business as we know it is undergoing a transformation. In
the past, no single individual had the resources to distribute
his work on a large scale. This has changed. The internet is now
ubiquitous. James Altucher in [Choose Yourself][2], calls it the
Choose Yourself Era. No one is going to pick you to succeed.
No one is going to spread the word about your work. No one
is looking out for you when you need to retire. You must 
take the initiative to build valuable skills, find your tribe,
and build a platform for sharing your work with the world.  


Work that doesn't touch the world is a tragic waste.

I will follow along with Josh Kaufman's [Personal MBA][3]. 
Traditional business has figured out how to consistently
deliver their work into the hands of people. Let's try to 
figure out how they do it.
